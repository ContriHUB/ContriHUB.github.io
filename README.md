## What is ContriHUB?

A month long contest starting from October 7th to get people involved in [Open Source](https://github.com/open-source). This repo is just the guide to get started on GitHub. We have a lot of different projects coming up. So start contributing and while you are at it, keep checking for more projects as they are added!

Choose any project and start fixing the issues. Every issue you fix will fetch you some points according to the difficulty. There are goodies waiting for you :P. So, Stay tuned and keep checking the repos [here](https://github.com/ContriHUB) for more projects and issues :smiley:

So, if you want to contribute to a particular project by either fixing an issue or adding a feature, all you have to do is

-   Fork the project
-   Create a new branch
-   Add a fix to the issue
-   Create a Pull Request
-   Submit the link to your Pull Request [here](https://contrihub21.herokuapp.com/)
-   Wait for it to accept and grab your points :smiley:

Also, please make sure to follow the proper formatting such as

```markdown
fixes #1
```

if you want your PR to be approved. The correct formatting should be followed.

If you don't know what the above means, just keep reading ... you'll get there.

We will not be accepting more PR's until the formatting of the current files is fixed. Please fix those, referencing the issues present. Also note that the issues and the PR have common # numbers , so the first issue might not be #1 but could be #138 . Please check this before referencing the issue. Incorrect # numbers will not be merged.
