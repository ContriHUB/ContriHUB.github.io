## What is ContriHUB?

A 25 days long contest from October 5th - October 29th to get people involved in [Open Source](https://github.com/open-source). This repo is just the guide to get started on GitHub. We have a lot of different projects coming up. So start contributing and while you are at it, keep checking for more projects as they are added!

Choose any project and start fixing the issues. You can propose new features too !! Every feature you add or an issue you fix will fetch you some points according to the difficulty. At the end of the month, one who has the most points will be the winner. There are goodies waiting for you :P. Also, there are special arrangements just for first year. So, Stay tuned and keep checking the repos [here](https://github.com/ContriHUB) for more projects and issues :smiley:


So, if you want to contribute to a particular project by either fixing an issue or adding a feature, all you have to do is 
* Fork the project
* Create a new branch
* Add a feature /fix the issue
* Create a Pull Request
* Submit the link to your Pull Request [here](http://contrihubs.herokuapp.com/)
* Wait for it to accept and grab your points :smiley:

Also, please make sure to follow the proper formatting such as

```markdown
fixes #1
```
if you want your PR to be approved. The correct formatting should be followed. We won't help you there.

If you don't know what the above means , just keep reading ... you'll get there.

We will not be accepting more PR's until the formatting of the current files is fixed. Please fix those, referencing the issues present. Also note that the issues and the PR have common # numbers , so the first issue might not be #1 but could be #138 . Please check this before referencing the issue. Incorrect # numbers will not be merged.

```html
<div class="col-auto" style="margin-bottom: 75px">
    <div class="card" style="width: 300px">
        <img class="card-img-top" src="{Link To Your Image}" alt="Card image">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h4 class="card-title">{Your Name}</h4>
            <p class="card-text">{Your Bio}</p>
            <a href="{Link To Your Github Profile}" class="btn btn-primary">See Profile</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

Please do not remove the sample participant info otherwise your Pull Request will not be merged.
